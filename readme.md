# Simple Spring Web-MVC application

This project has been made due to corresponding course of learning the Spring framework.

It is a CRUD application which is an information system of a certain library with the ability to add readers,
books and assign the latter to the first.

Example **properties** file for describing the Hibernate settings is placed at *src/main/resources/hibernate.properties.origin*
(please, remove *origin* suffix after setup).

Also, to prepare your database you can go to *init_postgres.sql* file and query all the statements.
**Be carefully**: queries in that file are prepared to be used with *PostgreSQL*, as mentioned in its name.
